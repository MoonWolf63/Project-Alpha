# Project Alpha
Project Alpha is a discord economy bot(Latest Discord.js Recommended)

## Installation

To install this you must have NODEJS installed for it to properly work (SUGGESTED NODEJS VERSION: 12.18.2). You must also have a MYSQL server for user data, I suggest using xampp or ubuntu mysql.
First you must open config.json and enter in your bot token.
Second you must open index.js and add your MYSQL data to the list (I plan on later making the MYSQL data into a .json file)
